Changelog for KD Chart 2.2
==========================

A) The following is a short list of the most important new
   implementations and advancements in KD Chart 2.2,
   compared to the KD Chart 2.1 release:

0. Performance - the most important improvement
   --------------------------------------------
   The following diagram types have been considerably tuned
   by partially re-designing their implementation and by
   adding caching technics where appropriate, so these
   time-critical diagram types are substantially enhanced
   in several ways:
   * Line diagrams,
   * Bar Diagrams,


1. New diagram types
   -----------------
   * Horizontal/Lying Bar Graphs in Normal, Stacked, Percent mode
   * Levey Jennings diagrams


2. New features
   ----------------------------
   * Qt::ToolTipRole
      to define tooltips (balloon help) for all kinds of data items
      like bars or points on a line, the tips texts can be QML strings
   * CartesianAxis::setAnnotations
      replaces the axis labels by your own texts at positions defined
      by you, these can have different step widths between each other
   * KDChart::CommentRole
      allows to define a comment text to be shown next to a data item
      permanently, may be used in addition or alternatively to tooltips
   * Qt::SortOrder is now supported by the Legend
   * its now possible to enable automated font shrinking for axis titles
   * its now possible to set the color of tick marks
   * Line charts now can be shown in Percent mode, even when using
     multi-dimensional data. As always for such data please use the
     Plotter class introduced in KD Chart 2.1.


B) The following is a list of all of the fixed issues in
   KD Chart 2.2, compared to the KD Chart 2.1 release,
   sorted by the issue numbers which we have reported to
   you when replying to your support mails.

   If in doubt of the relevance of any of these fixed issues
   for your projects please address us for detailed information!


Issue     	Summary
----	----------------------------------------------
2548	KDChart 2.1 Feature Wish - Axis title text - Allow the user
          to enable automatic font skrinking
3263	KD Chart 2.1 - Feature wish - Add a method to set the color
          of the tick marks
3669	KD Chart 2.1 - Feature wish - Horizontal stack bars
4228 	Have PERCENT LineDiagram even if x coordinates are present.
          However note that the Plotter class is to be used instead!
4249	(Vista) Pie Chart bug: randomly stops responding to sliders
4571	Y Coordinate flips when only one data value set
4572	ASSERT if succeeding points have same x-y values
4573	since 2.1: LineDiagram does not redraw on model reset anymore
4575	Axis subticks disappearing dependend on the range of the Y-Axis
4576	Large performance impact on using custom labels
4578	Printing issues: Labels drawn ouside of area / print quality bad:
          wrong font sizes, wrong stroke
4579	BarDiagram: Stacked View wrong when using negative and positive
          values together
4580	BarDiagram: Data labels are NOT shown on top of each bar
4581	Not enough space for the axis labels (sometimes)
4588	Grid circles in polar diagrams moved when startPosition changes
4637	number 1 is repeated for axis labels
4665	Plotter::setModel() doesnt trigger redraw without a legend
4666	Plotter::setPen() only works for first dataset
4667	Plotter draws spurious lines if datasets differ in length
4668	Logarithmic axes poorly annotated
4669	Logarithmic grid misaligned to data
4670	setVerticalRange() doesnt work with logarithmic axes
4671	Additional screenshots for issues 4665..4670
4674	strange behaviour of mouse at rubberband zooming
4675	wish: export paintContext or how to do it
4689	wish: support Qt::SortOrder for Legends of stacked BarDiagram
4816 	setMissingValuesPolicy() method results in wrong drawing
4817	code cleanup needed: setDatasetDimension(int) is causing trouble
4819	Crash in CartesianDiagramDataCompressor on calling
          QStandardItemModel::removeRow(int)
4837	Markers are not displayed for the first value of any data entry
4853	Removing row from item model causes diagram to not update properly
4862	Plotter: only first dataset is shown
4863	Ordinate axis space calculation too small in some cases
4865	Marker size is scale dependent
4866	issue Ref 247 - Incorrect Vertical Scale
4868	Plotter diagram does not scale to display small fractions
4871	wishes for the end-of-jan-2008 release: Data- and Axis- Annotations
4897	Implement horizontal/lying bar charts
4905	Bar width calculated in wrong way
4907	Distance of y-dimension mistakenly set in
          KDChartCartesianCoordinatePlane.cpp
4940 	Add signal or property to query the viewport (diagram area) size
4961 	Crash for logarithmic y axis calculation
4999 	Frame-Attributes buggy: No frames drawn
5021 	examples/Widget/Advanced: ASSERT when trying to add a new dataset
