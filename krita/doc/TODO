Integration

?  * there is currently no kimgio module for Krita images: implement one by
      saving a rendered png image into the krita file and extracting that from
      kimgio. (Saving of a png image in .kra files is done; now we just need to 
      add the kimgio file)

User Interface
    * Add out-of-gamut selection
    * Fix layout problems in tool option widgets.
    * Disable all relevant actions when a layer is locked or invisible. See bug #90456. Show locked status of current layer in statusbar.
    * Add link check to new image dialog to sync width and height
    * The description field in color settings is empty
    * Implement the following dialogs / widgets:
		    - Variations (#Boudewijn)
		    - Gradient: remove the autogradient dialog and make into a proper
				gradient dialog, and allow saving gradients.

    * Show which tool is associated with which pointer (mouse, stylus, eraser, other stylusses) In the statusbar.
    * Create templates for often-used image formats. Add save-as-template
    * Fix crop tool: when pressing shift, keep aspect ratio, implement gray mask.

    * Allow shape tools to be filled with gradients
    * Pressing save for the first time gives me the 'save document as' dialog 
      which is set to 'png' as default file format. I suggest to set the default format (in the "save as" dialog) to the krita 
      format for any image that has more then 1 layer.  


Tools

	* Zoom tool should zoom out when alt is pressed. Show zoom-minus cursor in that case
	* Implement the following tools or paintops: 
		    - fix airbrush tool (add rate option, add increase
		      of brush size if kept in one place)
		    - color changer, smudge tool,sharpen tool, blur
		      tool, dodge tool, burn tool, sponge tool (These
		      last are perhaps more generally: painting with
		      filters tool)
		    - stamp tool (paint with patttern/image selection) (#Cyrille)
		    - Text tool (use kotext with a transparent background here?)
		    - Measure tool
	            - calligraphic pen tool
 
	* Pressure sensivitize all relevant tools (e.g. line tool)
    * Add resize slider to freehand tools that resizes the mean brush size.
	* Implement path tools (Michael Thaler?)
