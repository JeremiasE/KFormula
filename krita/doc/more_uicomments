Yes, scaling :)

That's great. I wish it would be possible to compile SVN trunk.
./configure can't find my Qt4 libs even if I point the script to
correct path by -with-qt-libs=3D$PATH

I think it is, here is are a couple of examples of colorized photos:

Good to know :)

I see. Would it still be possible to work on improving icons within
KOffice style?

Hi Boudewijn,

First of all, congratulations to this release! I can barely imagine
amount of work all the team put into this release.

I decided to edit last photosession completely in Krita for the first
time, exporting images from UFRaw as 16bit TIFF and opening them in
Krita.

Here are several observations.

1. Cropping. Most of my pictures go to web, which is why after
cropping I still have to make an additional step and resize them. It
would be great to be able to save and reuse cropping presets. For
example:

- Web landscape (800x533px, 72 dpi)
- Web portrait (533x800px, 72 dpi)

plus some presets for printing with larger Width and Height values and
300dpi. Using ratio spinbox isn't that comfortable - I do it since the
first release of GIMP 2.3.x with new cropping tool and I'm not very
fond of it.

Thus required changes would be:

- add dpi value to cropping tool;
- add ability to resize by cropping;
- add presets mechanism.

Earlier I wrote about composition hints as guide lines while cropping.

2. Sharpening. Only simple non-adjustable sharpening tool is available
at the moment. It works for large images, but doesn't work for small
ones (images look oversharped), and one always needs applying some
sharpening after downscaling a photo.

It would be great having USM (Unsharp Mask) as adjustable layer.

Some useful info on unsharp masking:

3. Colorization. There is no colorization, neither as destructive
filter, nor as adjustment layer. This is a quite helpful filter when
you have lots of shots from a concert - because lighting on stage is
colored, pictures never look the way you see them and it's barely
fixable. Some people like it and some - difinitely not :)

4. Soft glow filter. Makes skin look softer, essential feature for
female portraits retouching :)

5. Hints. There are almost no hints/tooltips throughout interface. I
usually disable them, but beginners need them.

6. Tools icons.For me they are not much readable. Did you have a look
at ones in http://tango-project.org/ArtLibreSet ? Would be great
having them in Krita. Some are not ready yet, but of you consider
using ArtLibreSet, I could try to find some time for it or talk to
Andreas Nilsson who has already done similar work for Scribus
(http://scribus.sourceforge.net/gallery/tango/index.html).

Again, thank you for the great work on Krita!

Alexandre
