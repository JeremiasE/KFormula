  The KisImageRasteredCache keeps a big 'grid' associated with the
  image, and with each block in the grid, it has an associated element
  and then if a part of the image is changed, it queues those parts of
  the grid to be updated as well and then it slowly updates the grid
  items (and associated stuff when the image resizes and so) in this
  case, the 'elements' are mini histograms and they need to get
  updated so we put them on a queue, and if the user has done nothing
  for long enough (hence the timer), we'll update the histograms that
  became dirty
