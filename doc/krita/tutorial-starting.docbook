<title>Starting to know &krita;</title>

<para> So, let's show you all the niceties. In your &kde; menus,
&krita; should be placed either under Graphics or under Office &mdash;
it depends a bit on who packaged &koffice; for you. Or do what I do:
press <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>
(which opens krunner), type
<userinput><command>krita</command></userinput> and press
<guibutton>Enter</guibutton>. </para>

<para>
A little later, you'll be greeted by a dialog:
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>The <guilabel>Create Document</guilabel> dialog</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="createdocument.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>The <guilabel>Create Document</guilabel> dialog</phrase>
</textobject>
<caption><para>The <guilabel>Create Document</guilabel> dialog</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
This is standard for &koffice;: you can create a new document, choose a
document from among your files or select a document you had opened in an earlier
session. We have got a bunch of templates here, ordered by color model. &krita;
is a very flexible application and can handle many different types of images:
<acronym>CMYK</acronym> images for printers, <acronym>RGB</acronym> images for
the web, <acronym>RGB</acronym> images with high channel depths for
photographers; and more. For now, choose
<guilabel>Custom Document</guilabel>. That will allow
us to see the <guilabel>New Image</guilabel> dialog box:
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>The <guilabel>New Image</guilabel> dialog</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="newimage.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>The <guilabel>New Image</guilabel> dialog</phrase>
</textobject>
<caption><para>The <guilabel>New Image</guilabel> dialog</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
Here you can give your document a name, determine the dimensions and the
resolution. The resolution of your image determines its physical
size. An image with a resolution of 100 pixels per inch will take, at
100% zoom exactly one inch on screen or on paper. Of course, you can
also work in a mode where one pixel of your image is exactly one pixel
on your screen: more about that later.
</para>

<para>
The next group of options is very itneresting: &krita;
is an enormously flexible application and you can work with many kinds of
images. For this tutorial, just select <guilabel>RGB (8
bits/channel)</guilabel>. You can also select a profile. For now, we leave this
at the default setting of <guilabel>sRGB built-in - (lcms internal)</guilabel>.
</para>

<para> In the third option group, you can select the initial canvas
color. Furthermore you can add a description of the contents. We leave
these options at their default settings as well, so click
<guibutton>Create</guibutton> to actually create the new image. 
</para>

<para>
You will now see the main &krita; screen.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krita;'s main screen</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="mainscreen.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>&krita;'s main screen</phrase>
</textobject>
<caption><para>&krita;'s main screen</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
On the left hand side and on the top, there are toolbars which offer you access
to tools for painting, editing, and selecting. Note that the toolbox
on the left-hand side consists of two parts: the top part is the flake
toolbox and works on vector shapes, the bottom part (the biggest part,
actually) are the krita tools. By default, the krita freehand painting
tool is selected</para>

<para>You can find a more detailed description of these toolbars <link
linkend="commands-toolbars">here</link>. The actual painting area is in the
middle. On the right side of your screen, there are various palettes, which you
can read more about in <link linkend="commands-palettes">this section</link>.
Finally, there is a menu bar at the top of the screen, as usually. Read more
about it <link linkend="commands-menus">here</link>.
